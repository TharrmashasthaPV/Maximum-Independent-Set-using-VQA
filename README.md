# Maximum-Independent-Set-using-VQA
In this project, we perform a comparison study of various Variational Quantum Algorithms for the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. More specifically, we aim to compare the use of VQE, QAOA, ADAPT-QAOA, and CD-QAOA in solving the MIS problem. In addition, we aim to test how these algorithms perform for different graph classes and graphs of different sizes.

### Current Stage of the project:

Currently, we have constructed functions to generate random graph instances. We constructed custom `QAOA` and `AdaptQAOA` classes and used them to solve the MIS problem for generated arbitrary graph instances.
